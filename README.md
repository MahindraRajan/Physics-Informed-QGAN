# FastInversePhotonics: PINN + Quantum GAN Inverse Design Toolkit

##  Overview
FastInversePhotonics accelerates the inverse design of high-Q dielectric metasurfaces by combining **physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)** with **quantum-enhanced generative adversarial networks (QGANs)**. Embedded analytical resonance models (e.g., Fano-shaped spectra) ensure physical fidelity, while quantum generative modeling enables fast, high-dimensional design exploration—using **200× fewer training samples** and converging **25× faster** than traditional GANs. The result? Design outcomes with **two orders of magnitude higher Q-factors**, opening scalable pathways for rapid prototyping in sensing, imaging, and communication technologies.

##  Highlights
- **Physics-Informed Learning**: PINNs incorporate analytical resonance behaviors directly in the loss function to maintain spectral accuracy and physical consistency. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
- **Quantum-Enhanced GANs**: QGANs explore high-dimensional design spaces more efficiently, reducing both data and training requirements.
- **Performance Milestones**:
  - 200× fewer training samples  
  - 25× faster convergence  
  - Design Q-factors improved by ~100×
- **Scalability & Applicability**: Extensible across applications in photonics, including metasurfaces, sensors, and optical communication components.
